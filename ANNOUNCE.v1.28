[lvs-users] [ANNOUNCE] ipvsadm release v1.28

We are happy to announce the release of ipvsadm v1.28.
ipvsadm is a utility to administer the kernels IPVS/LVS load-balancer service
It has been quite a while since the previous release, v1.27. A number of
fixes and improvements have been made; most noticeably in the area of IPv6.
One big addition is the support for heterogeneous pools (v4 and v6
mixed pools in 3.18), by Alex Gartrell (facebook).
Feature wise the SCTP protocol has been added which is available via the
cmdline parameter "--sctp-service". The kernel has supported SCTP since
kernel 2.6.34 but up until now ipvsadm users have been restricted to using
fwmark-based virtual services for SCTP.
This release is based on the kernel.org git tree:
